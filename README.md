Device Tracking with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) / Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a way for different devices on a network to share information with each other. It allows devices to communicate even if the devices have different hardware and run different software. WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a technological invention of Microsoft whose purpose is to deal with different operating environments of Windows.

Detailed information about the devices whose ip addresses are taken in the project is listed, port scanning is performed and recorded in the database. If there is a change above the determined average in the recorded data, a report is given with the reporting system.
